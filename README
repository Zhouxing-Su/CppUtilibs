	by R.E.M.
==============================
some utility classes written by cpp.




USAGE
==============================
check the related header file to get the usage of the classes.
check "Tester.cpp" for code example for using each class.


CLASS LIST ( IMPLEMENTED )
==============================
[[ algorithm ]]
	[ BidirectionIndex ] :
	this can be used as an O(1) implementation of set<int>  
	when the integers are aggregate in certain range. 
	for example, vertex set in topological graph.

	[ Counter ] :
	auto incremental function object.

	[ Graph ] :
	Geometrical Graph/Topological Graph, DirectedGraph/UndirectedGraph.
	some basic algorithm on directed graph, such as
	bellman-ford/dijkstra/a-star for shortest path problem,
	and successive shortest path for min cost flow problem.

	[ Knapsack ] :
	knapsack solvers.

	[ Container ] :
	container wrappers.

	[ String ] :
	string processing algorithms.


[[ io ]]
	[ File ] :
	file operations.


[[ log ]]
	[ Log ] :
	make it easy to show log when debuging and 
	avoid too much log in release version.

	[ Timer ] :
	provide interface to check if timeout in single thread procedure.

	[ Trace ] :
	record program running state and dump call stack after crash.


[[ math ]]
	[ Interval ] :
	a range representation with some basic operations.

	[ Math ] :
	basic arithmetics.

	[ Oscillator ] :
	a number generator with an oscillating pattern.


[[ random ]]
	[ Random ] :
	wrap a random number generator with some simple probability distrubution.

	[ RandSelect ] :
	make it possible to pick one element out of a sequence of elements 
	by same probability without recording all of them.

	[ RandSample ] :
	an online algorithm for sampling targetNum items from a data stream.


[[ system ]]
	[ Directory ] :
	portable directory operations.

	[ Exception ] :
	complement common exception types in STL.

	[ Madro ] :
	some crazy mad macros.

	[ Memory ] :
	memory status reporter.

	[ Semaphore ] :
	a useful mechanism for synchronization.

	[ System ] :
	unified platform dependent macros.
	portable shell commands.

	[ Termination ] :
	program termination control.

	[ ThreadPool ] :
	a simple thread pool with restarting, pending and stopping.


[[ type ]]
	[ Arr ] :
	dynamic allocated array follows RAII idiom.

	[ Convert ] :
	convert between std::string and other type.

	[ Double ] :
	encaptured fundamental type double.
	make it easier to compare two real numbers by tolerating some error.

	[ LoopQueue ] :
	loop queue for the cases that the max number of items in queue is known.

	[ PriorityQueue ] :
	priority queue implemented by bucket, red-black tree or heap.
	
	[ VectorMD ] :
	simplify multi-dimensional vector representation.
	
	[ ZeroBasedConsecutiveIdMap ] :
	a number mapping utility.
	
	[ CombinationMap ] :
	mapping a combination of items to corresponding data.
	unlike the normal maps, the key is not a string or permutation.
